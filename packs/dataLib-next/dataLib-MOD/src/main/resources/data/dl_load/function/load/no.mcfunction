# dl_load:load/no
# Admin cancelled (or timeout fired) — DL load is ABORTED.
#
# datalib:engine storage is NOT touched at any point.
# The engine remains uninitialized and fully inert.
#
# IDEMPOTENT — safe to call multiple times.
# The #pending guard ensures this is a no-op if no gate is open.
#
# ALSO CALLED BY: dl_load:timeout (auto-cancel after 5 minutes)
#
# TO RETRY: run /reload  OR  /function dl_load:_
# (calling dl_load:_ directly re-runs stage0 without a full /reload)

# Guard: nothing pending
execute unless score #pending dl.load matches 1 run return 0

# Close the gate window
scoreboard players set #cancelled dl.load 1
scoreboard players set #pending dl.load 0
scoreboard players set #confirmed dl.load 0

# If admin called /no explicitly, cancel the still-pending timeout
schedule clear dl_load:timeout

# Announce cancellation via marker (works with zero players online)
