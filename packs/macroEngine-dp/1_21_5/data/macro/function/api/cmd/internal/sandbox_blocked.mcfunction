# macro:api/cmd/internal/sandbox_blocked [1.21.5+ overlay]
# Extends the base sandbox_blocked with a test_block server log entry.
#
# NOTE (v5.1.0): The primary sandbox enforcement path now goes through
# macro:api/cmd/internal/sandbox_gate → macro:core/security/type_violation.
# This function is retained for direct callers and backwards compatibility.
# The type_violation overlay (1_21_5) handles test_block logging for the
# new gate path.
#
# test_block (log mode) was added in Java Edition 25w03a (1.21.5).
# When powered by redstone it writes its message to the server log file,
# providing a persistent audit trail outside the in-game log buffer.
#
# Block placement uses y=-62 in the AME forceloaded chunk (0,0).
# The block is placed, powered, and immediately removed in the same tick.
