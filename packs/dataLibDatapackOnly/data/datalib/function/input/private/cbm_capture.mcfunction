# Only reached when cbm_process confirmed Command is non-empty. Runs with
# @s still bound to that minecart.
#
# TOCTOU note: snapshot into datalib:input BEFORE clearing Command, so a
# later tick mutating the entity's NBT cannot change what we already
# captured this tick.
#
# Entity handling matches TunnelScript: Command is cleared back to "" so
# the minecart is reusable and is NOT killed. This also matches the
# 'tunnelscript_input' tag Legends11 uses elsewhere (cbm_align_tp), which
# assumes the tagged minecart persists in the world.
