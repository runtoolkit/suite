# ame_load:timeout
# Fires 5 minutes after ame_load:load/confirm if no admin response.
#
# Uses the marker say pattern so the log message appears even when
# zero players are online (unlike tellraw @a).
#
# Delegates to ame_load:load/no which is idempotent — if the admin
# already ran /yes or /no, the #pending guard in load/no returns 0
# and nothing happens.
